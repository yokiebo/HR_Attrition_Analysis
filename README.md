# HR_Attrition_Analysis

Data Source: https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data-season-2/workspace/file?filename=HR_Attrition.csv
Tableau Visualization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edgar.orong/viz/HRAttritionDashboardProject_16865853535310/Viz

**Steps I took to complete the project:**
1. Prepped and cleaned 3 years of HR Attrition dataset using Excel
2.  Imported cleaned data into Postgresql for the purpose of conducting Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Built visualization in Tableau to show the factors contributing to attrition in the company as well as monitor current drivers of attrition and prevent new ones from emerging.
